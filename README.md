Hi! I'm Alice Yue, a researcher at Metafora-biosystems. I recently got my PhD in the department of computing science at SFU (CGPA: 4.33/4.33). Previously, I recieved my MSc at SFU and my BSc with distinction at UVic (CGPA:8.7/9.0) in the beautiful city of Victoria.

Research interests: I develop machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis methods for high-dimensional and graph structured data. In computational biology, I have applied my methods on flow cytometry (<3), scRNAseq, and DNA sequence data.
