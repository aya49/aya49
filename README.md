Hi! I'm Alice Yue, a PhD candidate in the department of computing science at SFU (CGPA: 4.33/4.33) based in Vancouver, Canada, under the supervision of Cedric Chauve, Maxwell Libbrecht, and Ryan Brinkman. Previously, I recieved my MSc at SFU and my BSc with distinction at UVic (CGPA:8.7/9.0) in the beautiful city of Victoria.

Research interests: I develop machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis methods for high-dimensional and graph structured data. In computational biology, I have applied my methods on flow cytometry, scRNAseq, and DNA sequence data.
